              <p>
                <b>Hi there!</b> I am a second year MS student in Computer Science at Stanford University on the Artificial Intelligence track. I am currently member of the <a href="https://svl.stanford.edu/">Stanford Vision Lab</a> under Prof. Fei-Fei Li and Prof. Jiajun Wu, where I work on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/behavior-1k">BEHAVIOR</a> project in robotic simulation benchmarking and the <a href="https://github.com/corgiTrax/AIDA">AIDA</a> (Attention-driven data augmentation) project which aims to improve image classification performance using a saliency-map based augmentation. I consider myself a generalist in AI and am interested in the broad domains of Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Explainability, Reinforcement Learning & Decision Making, Graph Neural Networks.
                <!-- I am also very interested in the applications of perception-based systems and AI to a variety of scenarios, from Astronomy to Autonomous Systems. -->
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated in 2021 from Columbia University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Physics. As an undergrad, I was supervised by <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/"> Prof. Daniel Hsu</a> and <a href="https://datascience.columbia.edu/people/zoltan-haiman/"> Prof. Zoltan Haiman</a> on interpreting astrophysical deep learning models for weak lensing using an array of saliency map methods. I started off my undergraduate program with a broad interest in computational physics and first pursued the direction of AI at Caltech in 2019, under <a href="https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~mansi/"> Prof. Mansi Kasliwal </a> in which I developed a real/bogus image astrophysical source classifier for the IR-Gattini telescope that performed so well that it was permanently included in the telescope's data processing pipeline. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As I entered graduate school, unfulfilled by the relatively limited impact astrophysics can have on current-life and real-world affairs, my interest in AI broadened to 
              include more real-world applications that had a greater focus on human and human-computer interaction, such as robotics and AV. I am now looking for full-time roles (starting 2023) and am very excited to learn about opportunities for the application of deep-learning and/or perception-based systems to a variety of scenarios!
            </p>

              <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful algorithms that have been proven capable of extracting non-Gaussian information from weak lensing (WL) datasets. We apply a series of well-established saliency methods to interpret the DNN and find that the most relevant pixels are those with extreme K values. For noiseless maps, regions with negative K account for 69%-89%. of the attribution of the DNN output, defined as the square of the saliency in input space. In the presence of shape noise, the attribution concentrates in high-convergence regions, with 36%-68% of the attribution in regions with highest 3rd standard deviation of K values. </p>

              <p>Palomar Gattini-IR is a new wide-field, near-infrared (NIR) robotic time domain survey operating at Palomar Observatory. Using a 30 cm telescope mounted with a H2RG detector, Gattini-IR achieves a field of view (FOV) of 25 sq. deg. with a pixel scale of 8 7 in J-band. Here, we describe the system design, survey operations, data processing system and on-sky performance of Palomar Gattini-IR. To automatically distinguish between an astrophysical source and image subtraction artifacts, we use a ML based real-bogus (RB) classification scheme. Bogus candidates were compiled using a labeling scheme on Zooniverse, a citizen science web portal which allows set up of individual projects usually pertaining to classification and data visualization. The performance of the model was evaluated using the following metrics: accuracy on the test set of 0.975, a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.949 and an F1 score of 0.977. </p>

                          <li> In the summer of 2022, I started writing a bi/tri-weekly blog called 'Manasi's Musings' about an array of topics, from my personal journey to my thoughts on LiDAR vs. camera data in AVs to robotic benchmarking, etc. The goal is to cover a sub-topic or question of interest in bite-sized pieces, a maximum 3 min read. The readers are currently mostly friends, colleagues and peers in my network but I hope to reach a wider audience through social media. I started the blog as I missed the process of writing-- I had actually maintained an Astrophysics blog during my high school and early undergraduate program, but stopped due to the commitments of completing my degree. I am so excited to restart, and you can check it out here! __ </li>
